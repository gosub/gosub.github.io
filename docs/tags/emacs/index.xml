      <description>&lt;p&gt;The People of Emacs are my tribe, even if I never met anyone of them in person.&#xA;They are my tribe because I believe that sharing matters, and I feel that they&#xA;do too. I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to use and enjoy Emacs all these years because of their&#xA;generosity, and I hope one day to pay them back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The People of Emacs have been my tribe since I first watched the video lectures&#xA;for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090&#34;&gt;MIT 6.001 Structure and Intepretation of Computer Programs&lt;/a&gt;, and what I saw&#xA;expressed something I had always felt subconsciously, but had never been able to&#xA;articulate: that computer use and computer programming were fundamentally the&#xA;same activity; that coding was closer to casting spells than to doing&#xA;engineering; and that Lisp was the arcane language of choice for spellbinding&#xA;the computer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
