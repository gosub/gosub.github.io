      <description>&lt;p&gt;XOR has always struck me as the odd one among the logical operators; since I&#xA;first learned about it, I always felt a strange fascination with it. I think I&#xA;was taught about it by my father, who cultivated my interest in computers and&#xA;taught me programming when I was 7. I remember that the AND and OR operations&#xA;were clear to me, and their use in the logic of a program; on the other hand,&#xA;XOR seemed esoteric and not really useful, since I could easily program the same&#xA;behavior with a combination of AND and OR.  As I progressed in my programming&#xA;journey and learned much more, I became aware of the strangeness and power of&#xA;XOR. In this post, I explore the many interpretations of XOR, and why it&#xA;deserves a unique appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
