** The People of Emacs are my tribe :emacs:carnival:

The People of Emacs are my tribe, even if I never met anyone of them in person.
They are my tribe because I believe that sharing matters, and I feel that they
do too. I've been able to use and enjoy Emacs all these years because of their
generosity, and I hope one day to pay them back.

The People of Emacs have been my tribe since I first watched the video lectures
for [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090][MIT 6.001 Structure and Intepretation of Computer Programs]], and what I saw
expressed something I had always felt subconsciously, but had never been able to
articulate: that computer use and computer programming were fundamentally the
same activity; that coding was closer to casting spells than to doing
engineering; and that Lisp was the arcane language of choice for spellbinding
the computer.

The People of Emacs are my tribe because the tool that they have created
reflects many of the principles I hold about software. Some of those priciples
are:

- Software should be free, as in freedom
- Sotware should be programmable, and in the same language it is written in
- [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/][Explicit is better than implicit]]
- Plain text always wins in the long term
- [[https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html][It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures]] (and that data structure is the cons cell)

The People of Emacs are my tribe, and [[https://fosstodon.org/@gosub/115599166682104187][I hope to meet some of them soon]].

This post is my entry for [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Carnival][Emacs Carnival]] for [[https://curious.port111.com/2025/11/01/emacs-carnival-december-the-people.html][December 2025]].

I wish there was a personal music player in a smartwatch form factor. It would
be a device I could easily take along on a long walk, with uninterrupted music,
free from notifications, and able to display the song title and artist with just
a wrist turn.

Here's what such a device should ideally offer:
- Completely offline functionality
- No smartphone syncing required
- Local storage of at least 64/128 GB, with SD card expandability
- Bluetooth connectivity for headphones or speakers
- A large, low-power screen for easy visibility

** Soldering Musikding "Der Acapulco" overdrive kit :diy:stompbox:der_acapulco:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2024-12-30-soldering-der-acapulco
:EXPORT_DATE: 2024-12-30T16:40:07+01:00
:END:

I took advantage of the winter holidays to solder and assemble "[[https://www.musikding.de/The-Acapulco-Overdrive-kit][Der Acapulco]]"
 overdrive pedal kit from [[https://www.musikding.de/][Musikding.de]]. The pedal is a clone of the
"[[https://www.earthquakerdevices.com/acapulco-gold][Acapulco Gold]]" pedal from EarthQuaker Device, which is itself based on the power
section of a vintage Sunn Model T amplifier. The circuit is very simple, it
consists of two LM386 op-amps in series and a single large knob to adjust the
volume.

It was my first soldering experience, and I must say that it was not difficult,
once you acquired a minimum of soldering technique and found the right
combination of solder and soldering iron temperature.

*** General soldering tips

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jAw41LRBxU][This HackMakeMod video]] is the best soldering tutorial I've found online
- I was happy with 0.5mm solder wire, 60/40 lead-tin
- Using the video table I set the soldering iron to 370°C
- The best soldering technique I've found so far is:
  1) touch the tip of the soldering iron to the metal base of the hole and the leg of the component
  2) bring the solder wire close to the point where the three elements touch
  3) let the solder melt for a few seconds (the amount is learned with experience)
  4) remove the solder wire, leave the soldering iron for a few more seconds
  5) after the solder has flowed into the hole, remove the iron

At first I had trouble making clean solder joints with the classic inverted cone
shape, but I was using a solder wire too large, with a melting temperature too
high and I was keeping the soldering iron at a low temperature. Once these three
parameters were adjusted, it was much easier to make soldering joints like those
seen in online tutorials.

*** Specific advice for "Der Acapulco"

In the kit, even if the enclosure is included in the order, there is no knob for
the potentiometer. It must be added separately to the order, otherwise, like me,
you will be forced to order another pedal kit and an extra knob.

Like most guitar pedals, the input jack is on the right and the output jack on
the left. At my first power-on test I thought my pedal didn't work, but I had
only reversed input and output.

The footswitch has no direction, you can only mount it on the daughter board
with the pins aligned horizontally, but you can swap the top with the bottom
with no consequences.

When the instructions say that the LED must have the long pin on the right side,
it means on your right side while looking inside the enclosure. the long pin
must go in the hole on the board indicated with the +.

When soldering capacitors, the positive side is indicated on the board with a +,
while on the capacitors themselves, the negative side is indicated with a light
band, so the light band must be soldered opposite to the +.

Resistors do not have a direction, they can be soldered in both directions, as
well as the ceramic capacitor, the one indicated on the board as C4.

Inspired by the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbQn_pRpsL8][video from mylarmelodies]] where he discuss with Tom Whitwell
about The Music Thing Workshop System.  In that video Tom says that he created a
random patch generator for the Workshop System, and I wanted to make one for
the synth I have, the Behringer Edge.
